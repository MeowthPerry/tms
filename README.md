# Tournament Management System

The Tournament Management System is a solution designed to optimize the process of managing and
organizing tournaments. Traditional tournament management methods are often associated with
time-consuming manual tasks (such as scheduling, tracking points) and the lack of a centralized
system, which often leads to errors, inefficiency and lack of real-time information. The Tournament
Management System solves these problems and offers additional functionality to improve the overall
experience of the tournament.
